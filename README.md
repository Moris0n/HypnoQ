# HypnoQ

**HypnoQ** is a Q&A chatbot designed to educate potential clients about cognitive hypnotherapy. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to provide accurate, tailored information, addressing common misconceptions and alleviating concerns about hypnotherapy.  

The chatbot offers an anonymous, non-intimidating way for users to learn about cognitive hypnotherapy before deciding to engage with a human therapist.  

The chatbot is designed to be integrated into a cognitive hypnotherapist‚Äôs website, offering accurate and specific responses that align with the unique aspects of cognitive hypnotherapy rather than general hypnotherapy, ensuring that users receive reliable, relevant information.

### Project RAG Flow
![rag indexing](readme_img/index.jpg " indexing")
**Indexing** 
1. Load: loading the q&a markdown file.
2. Split: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. In rhis project the questions and answers where in a good size so using `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` splitting on Header 4 was suffiecent.
3. Store: FAISS VectorStore and Embeddings model were used to index and store the splits.

![rag retrieval](readme_img/retrieve.jpg " retrieval")
**Retrieval and generation** 
4. Retrieve: Given a potential client question, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.
5. Generate: Groq with mixtral-8x7b-32768 produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a makedown file contains past clients common asked questions and therapist answers. 

You can find the data in `data/markdown_files`

- Login: "admin"
- Password: "admin"

### Dashboards

The monitoring dashboard contains several panels:  

![dashboard1](readme_img/grafana_01.png " dashboard1") 

1. **Relevant Answer (Gauge Chart):** This chart visualizes the relevance of responses during conversations. It uses color-coded thresholds to represent different levels of response quality, allowing for a quick assessment of how relevant the answers are.

2. **User Feedback (Pie Chart):** A pie chart displaying user feedback, breaking down the number of positive (thumbs up) and negative (thumbs down) responses. This panel provides insights into overall user satisfaction.

3. **Recent Conversations (Table):** A table listing the five most recent questions, including details like the question, answer, relevance score, and timestamp. This panel helps track and review the latest user interactions.  

![dashboard2](readme_img/grafana_02.png " dashboard2")

1. **Response Time (Time Series):** A time series chart that tracks the response times of conversations over a given period. This panel is valuable for identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring the system maintains quick response times.

2. **Response Time Breakdown (Time Series):** This chart splits the overall response time into two components: the time taken by the LLM to generate an answer and the time it takes to evaluate the response. It displays a time series of each, providing deeper insights into system performance.  

![dashboard3](readme_img/grafana_03.png " dashboard3")

1. **Tokens Used (Time Series):** A time series chart that monitors the number of tokens consumed during conversations over time. This helps analyze usage patterns and the amount of data being processed.

2. **Token Breakdown (Time Series):** This chart separates token usage into two categories: prompt tokens and completion tokens. It provides a time series view of each, offering insights into how tokens are distributed between input and output during conversations.  

3. **Evaluation Tokens (Time Series):** A time series chart tracking the number of tokens used during the evaluation phase of conversations over time. This helps in understanding the token consumption related to the model's evaluation process.

4. **Evaluation Token Breakdown (Time Series):** This chart separates evaluation token usage into two parts: tokens used for the prompt during evaluation and tokens generated for the completion. It provides a time series view of each, allowing for detailed analysis of token distribution during the evaluation phase.

5. **Total Tokens (Time Series):** A time series chart showing the total number of tokens used across all conversations over time, providing an overview of token consumption.

6. **Total Token Breakdown (Time Series):** This chart splits the total tokens into prompt and completion tokens, offering a quick comparison of their usage over time.
Here‚Äôs how you can explain the manual setup process in your README file:

### Manual Setup for Grafana and Postgres

#### 1. Add the Postgres Datasource to Grafana
1. Open your Grafana instance in a web browser (default: `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Log in with the default credentials (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`, unless you‚Äôve changed it).
3. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** from the left-hand menu.
4. Click **Add data source**, select **PostgreSQL**.
5. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Host**: `postgres:5432` or just `postgres`
   - **Database**: `hypno_analytics`
   - **User**: `mor` or your username (in case you changed it)
   - **Password**: Use the Postgres password defined in your environment variables or Docker Compose file.
   - Leave the other settings as default (e.g., SSL mode: `disable`).
6. Click **Save & Test** to verify the connection.

#### 2. Run the `generate_data.py` Script in the Postgres Docker Container
This step generates the analytics data required by your Grafana dashboard.

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to access the Postgres Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres bash
   ```
2. Once inside the container, navigate to the directory containing the script:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/models/src/analytics
   ```
   (Make sure this path is correctly mapped in your Docker setup.)
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python generate_data.py
   ```
   This script will populate the Postgres database with the required analytics data.

#### 3. Load the Dashboard into Grafana
1. In Grafana, navigate to **Dashboards** > **Manage** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Import**.
3. Click **Upload JSON file** and select the file `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/ChatBot Dashboard-1727707805906.json`.
4. Choose the appropriate data source (your Postgres datasource) when prompted.
5. Click **Import** to load the dashboard.

Your Grafana dashboard should now be ready to display data.
