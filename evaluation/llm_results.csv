Your unconscious is in a much more receptive position when you are in this relaxed state. Therefore, it is an incredibly effective tool, to take you towards your solution. When combined with other tools and techniques, such as NLP, can make short work of long-standing problems.  
And yes, it is a safe, and natural state that we all go in and out of many times during our day, perhaps without even knowing it. If you have ever been driving along a road and then ‘come to’ and wondered who was in control of the car for the last five minutes, or been ’miles away’ when someone is trying to talk to you – that’s trance, and we are all very good at it. It’s a little like day-dreaming for some people, but it also often heightens the awareness of the senses too.","Hypnosis is a safe and natural state that we all experience multiple times a day, often without realizing it. It's similar to daydreaming, where our unconscious mind is more receptive to suggestions. During hypnotherapy sessions, the hypnotherapist uses this state to make positive suggestions based on the client's goals, facilitating change in thoughts, feelings, and behavioral patterns. It is not a deep sleep, and the client remains in control, aware of their surroundings, and able to talk or open their eyes at any time.

Hypnotic trance feels like a pleasant, relaxed sensation, with heightened awareness of one's surroundings for some individuals. The experience varies from person to person, but most people report feeling more relaxed after a session.

Trance is an everyday phenomenon, with approximately 90% of our behavior being unconscious. Cognitive Hypnotherapy views trance as a naturally occurring state that can be used to effect change in thought processes, feelings, and behavioral patterns. The hypnotherapist's role is to help the client understand these processes and take control of the patterns that serve them poorly, ultimately giving them back control of their life.

It is not possible to get stuck in hypnosis, as it is similar to daydreaming. If left in trance, a person would either drift into sleep or become fully conscious again. The challenge lies in snapping out of the 'trance' created by our minds to protect us from perceived threats, which is where Cognitive Hypnotherapy can be helpful."
56e6efa8-ef1c-4c09-aafd-80e3e0764346,What is Cognitive Hypnotherapy?,"Cognitive Hypnotherapy is a person-centered, flexible, and transformational approach designed to equip you with the practical tools you need to bring about meaningful and lasting changes in your life. It utilizes light trance, which is similar to the everyday nature of daydreaming, or getting lost in thought while driving a car.  
Cognitive Hypnotherapy draws on a broad range of therapeutic techniques – including NLP, CBT, Psychotherapy, Gestalt, Positive Psychology, Traditional Hypnotherapy, Transactional Analysis and more. Practitioners don’t treat labels with standard scripts. We treat people, and we approach each person as the unique individual that they are.  
The main pillars of Cognitive Hypnotherapy:  
1. **All behavior has a positive intention.**  
Our subconscious is trying to protect us all the time from what it perceives as a threat. So its intention is right, but the outcome often isn’t. Around 90% of what we do is unconsciously driven, and not all these natural responses to experiences are helpful.  
2. **We are all doing the best we can with what we have available**  
Everyone has arrived at their issue through a series of experiences that have shaped (programmed) their minds in a unique way. QCH Therapy helps us to change this unconscious programming that affects our behaviour and holds us back.  
3. **Trance is something we do every day, without even realizing**  
We all go in and out of trance every day, often without realizing. When we are ‘doing’ our ‘problem’ we are in this trance state too. It works by ‘de-hypnotising’ us – to change the way we think and behave toward our particular problem.  
4. **You have everything you need within, to create the life you want**  
You are the expert on your life. Guided by an experienced practitioner, Cognitive Hypnotherapy provides you with the tools, knowledge, and skills you need to take back control of your own thoughts, behaviors, and feelings.","Cognitive Hypnotherapy is a flexible and transformational approach to therapy that utilizes light trance, similar to daydreaming or getting lost in thought. It draws on a variety of therapeutic techniques, such as NLP, CBT, Psychotherapy, Gestalt, Positive Psychology, Traditional Hypnotherapy, and Transactional Analysis. The main principles of Cognitive Hypnotherapy include the positive intention of all behavior, the idea that people do the best they can with their available resources, the everyday nature of trance, and the belief that individuals have the ability to create the life they want within themselves.

A: Will hypnotherapy work for me?
Hypnotherapy can be effective for anyone open to change. It is a process of mental reprogramming that requires the individual's active participation. The most successful clients are curious, open to self-discovery, and willing to put in the work. The hypnotherapist serves as a guide and supporter, but ultimately, the individual is responsible for their own change.

A: What is trance?
Trance is a natural, everyday state that we all experience. It is similar to daydreaming or being on autopilot. Cognitive Hypnotherapy views trance as an opportunity to understand and influence our thought processes, feelings, and behavioral patterns. During a trance state, individuals are physically present but mentally focused elsewhere. The goal of Cognitive Hypnotherapy is to help individuals de-hypnotize themselves from unhelpful trance states and regain control of their lives.

A: What do we mean by hypnotherapy?
Hypnotherapy is not a state of being controlled by the hypnotherapist. Instead, the hypnotherapist serves as a facilitator and guide. The individual remains in control of their mind and body, and can talk or open their eyes at any time. During hypnotherapy sessions, the individual engages in conversations with their unconscious mind, leading to small changes in thoughts and behaviors that gradually grow into larger changes over time."

55e90ead-8d05-496f-86a5-d0ec121cbe5d,Q: What do we mean by hypnotherapy?,"People tend to think of hypnotherapy as something that is done to them. This couldn’t be further from the truth. You won’t be ‘under my control’, you will not lose control of your mind or body, and you won’t be going into a deep sleep. You’re in control. I’m merely there as a facilitator and guide.  Sometimes you may close your eyes and listen to me, but you will always have the sense of where you are and what you are doing and can talk or open your eyes whenever you want.  
These conversations with your unconscious mind lead you to leave our sessions feeling a little bit ‘different’ and you’ll notice changes start to appear in the way you act & feel. While they start small, these little course corrections gradually grow into much bigger changes.  You start to notice how you are thinking differently and behaving differently – moving towards your future self.","Hypnotherapy is a process of mental reprogramming that involves conversations with your unconscious mind, guided by a trained hypnotherapist. It is not a state where you lose control of your mind or body, or go into a deep sleep. Instead, you remain in control and aware of your surroundings, and can talk or open your eyes whenever you want. Through this process, you will learn how to think, behave, and feel differently, leading to gradual changes in your thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. It's important to note that while the hypnotherapist can guide and support you, ultimately the success of hypnotherapy depends on your willingness to be curious, learn about yourself, and put in the work."
1ef71159-8d1d-4f78-85c4-31bfefcb23f6,Q: Will hypnotherapy work for Me?,"Everyone is capable of change. Whether you will effect that change is largely down to you. Cognitive Hypnotherapy isn’t a miracle pill. It’s a process of mental reprogramming. Our sessions will guide you to learn how to think, behave, and feel differently.  
Since I began practicing as a therapist, I’ve noticed some common traits among the clients who have made the most positive changes in their lives. They are curious, willing to learn about themselves, and being prepared to put in the work. I can guide you. And I will support you always. But nobody can do it for you.","The text suggests that everyone is capable of change, and hypnotherapy can be an effective tool for facilitating that change. However, it emphasizes that the success of hypnotherapy largely depends on the individual's willingness to learn about themselves, their curiosity, and their readiness to put in the work. The hypnotherapist will guide and support the individual, but ultimately, the individual must take an active role in their own transformation. Therefore, while hypnotherapy can be an effective approach, it may not work for everyone, particularly those who are not prepared to actively participate in the process."
481d5f91-3a34-451d-a9cd-0e628b6d5457,Q: What is Trance?,"Trance is an everyday phenomenon.  Studies suggest that approximately 90% of our behavior is unconscious. That means we are only truly in control of our actions one tenth of the time. In Cognitive Hypnotherapy, we see trance as a naturally occurring, everyday state. If you think of times you catch yourself ‘day dreaming’ or being ‘on auto-pilot’ – these are all examples of trance states where you are physically present, but your mind is somewhere else. So, if we’re at the mercy of our unconscious mind almost all of the time, then it stands to reason it’s the first lever to pull if we want to effect change in our thought processes, feelings and behavioral patterns. Cognitive Hypnotherapy helps you to understand these processes, and ultimately take control of the ones that serve you poorly. The work of the Cognitive Hypnotherapist is not to hypnotize you, but to help de-hypnotise you from these unhelpful states, and give you back control of your life.  
Everyone experiences trance slightly differently. But in general, you will feel relaxed but still aware of whatever is going on around you – my voice, background noise, and the content of your thoughts. Although it is not the same as sleep, many people feel refreshed afterwards. Others feel little difference after being in trance. But most people comment on what a pleasant experience it was. Some of these trances are the result of significant emotional events in our lives. For example, a traumatic childhood experience with a dog that has led to a lifelong fear of dogs. It’s when you encounter a problem like this that you may find Cognitive Hypnotherapy life changing. Whatever it is, I will listen to your problem, and together we will explore how that problem has been affecting your life. We’ll then work together to disrupt that pattern, using interventions and hypnosis techniques. Together, we can undo the negative feelings you’re experiencing and move you towards your own personal solution state.","Trance is a naturally occurring, everyday state of mind where your unconscious mind is more receptive to suggestions, and you may be physically present but your mind is elsewhere. This state is often experienced when you are daydreaming or on autopilot. Cognitive Hypnotherapy aims to help you understand and take control of your unconscious processes, including unhelpful thought patterns, feelings, and behaviors. The hypnotherapist's role is not to hypnotize you but to guide you towards de-hypnotizing yourself from these unhelpful states.

Trance can feel like daydreaming, and it is generally a very pleasant sensation where you remain conscious of your surroundings. You might choose to drift off with your own thoughts during the session, and most people report feeling relaxed during and after hypnosis.

In the context of hypnotherapy, trance is a safe and natural state that can be used as an effective tool for making positive changes in your life. It is similar to the daydreaming state, and we all experience it multiple times throughout our day.

3f96d283-6d4c-4ff0-8b49-5b0ca1834a8c,Q: Is it possible to get stuck in hypnosis?,"No, this isn’t possible. Think of hypnosis as being similar to day-dreaming. You may day-dream, but you always re-focus, snap back, and become fully conscious of yourself again. Even if I were to leave you in trance and walk out of the room, you would in time either drift into sleep or open your eyes. The problem occurs not when we’re ‘stuck’ in hypnosis, but when we’re stuck in the fantasy our minds have created for ourselves, to protect us from whatever threat it is we perceive. Essentially, Cognitive Hypnotherapy helps you to snap out of the ‘trance’ state that is negatively impacting your life.","No, it isn't possible to get stuck in hypnosis. Hypnosis is similar to daydreaming, and just like when you're daydreaming, you always refocus and become fully conscious again. If a hypnotherapist were to leave you in a trance state and leave the room, you would either drift into sleep or open your eyes. The real issue arises not from being ""stuck"" in hypnosis, but from being stuck in the fantasy your mind creates to protect you from perceived threats. Cognitive Hypnotherapy helps you to snap out of the trance state that negatively impacts your life."

The aim of our client-therapist relationship is not to control you in any way – it’s to free you from what does control you currently. Rest assured, that involves nothing but treating you in professional, non-judgmental, and ethical way.","Based on the information provided, the answer is no, you cannot be made to do anything you do not want to do during hypnotherapy sessions. The hypnotherapist's goal is to help you gain control over any factors currently influencing you negatively, rather than exerting control over you. The relationship between the client and therapist is built on professionalism, non-judgment, and ethics, ensuring that your autonomy and consent are respected throughout the process. If you have any further concerns or questions, it is always best to reach out to the hypnotherapist directly for clarification."
42cabac5-3428-414a-9b21-d5116dab59c5,Q: How many sessions will I need?,"It’s not a case of X problem requires Y sessions. Every person I treat is unique, and so too is their own road to where they want to get to. We never know where any session may lead, or what it may uncover.
What I can say with certainty, is that one of the most significant things to impact the course of your treatment will be your willingness to commit to the process. Particularly your commitment in between sessions – working through the exercises I give you.","The number of sessions needed can vary greatly from person to person, as every individual is unique and has their own specific goals and challenges. The hypnotherapist's approach is tailored to each client, and the course of treatment will depend on the client's willingness to commit to the process, especially in between sessions when they are working through the exercises provided. It's not possible to predict an exact number of sessions, as each session may lead to new discoveries and uncover new areas to focus on.

Q: How do I book a session?

To book a session, you can visit the hypnotherapist's contact page to send a message or call directly. If the hypnotherapist is not available, they will make every effort to return your call within 24 hours.

Q: What is expected of a client?

Additionally, the hypnotherapist may provide tasks or exercises to be completed between sessions. These tasks are designed to facilitate change and growth, and full participation is an essential part of the treatment."

Occasionally I may see clients in their own home if their needs make this necessary, although it has to be a suitable environment for treatment to be effective.","The hypnotherapist offers sessions in their therapy rooms located in Hersham, Esher, and Wimbledon. They also provide the option for online sessions through Zoom. In certain situations, the hypnotherapist may consider conducting sessions in a client's home if the client's needs require it and if the environment is suitable for effective treatment.

I may give you tasks to complete between sessions too. These won't be too onerous, but it is often said that the biggest changes happen between sessions, as your unconscious mind absorbs and processes what we’ve been working through. Your full participation in these tasks is a necessary part of treatment.","The hypnotherapist expects a few key things from their clients to ensure the success of the hypnotherapy services. First, the client's willing engagement is essential. This means that the client should be open and committed to the process. Honesty is also crucial, as it allows the hypnotherapist to provide the most effective treatment. The hypnotherapist will also maintain openness and honesty with the client.

Additionally, the hypnotherapist may give the client tasks to complete between sessions. These tasks are designed to facilitate continued progress and are not intended to be burdensome. Completing these tasks is an essential part of the treatment process, as significant changes often occur between sessions as the unconscious mind absorbs and processes the work done in the sessions.

In summary, a client can expect to actively engage in the hypnotherapy process, be open and honest, complete any assigned tasks, and discuss any concerns or reservations with the hypnotherapist."

It’s a process we have to work through together. What I can guarantee is you will have my full professional commitment to your treatment and that I will guide and support you as best I’m able. A great many of my clients have found this process has led to positive lasting changes in their lives – and I hope you can too.","Based on the provided context, the hypnotherapist does not offer a guarantee for their services.

While many clients have experienced positive and lasting changes in their lives through this process, individual results may vary. Therefore, the hypnotherapist cannot offer a guarantee for the services' outcomes.

Generally it’s a very pleasant sensation where you are conscious of what is going on around you and what is happening throughout the session, but may choose to ‘drift off’ with your own thoughts from time to time.

So, we all experience it differently, and the one thing I do know is that everyone’s experience is unique, so it isn’t possible to get it ‘wrong’. The way you experience hypnosis is the right way for you, and it may well be different to someone else.  
However, most people comment on how relaxed they feel during hypnosis.
