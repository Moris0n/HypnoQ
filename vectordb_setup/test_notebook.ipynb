Whether you will effect that change is largely down to you. Cognitive Hypnotherapy isn’t a miracle pill. It’s a process of mental reprogramming. Our sessions will guide you to learn how to think, behave, and feel differently.  \\nSince I began practicing as a therapist, I’ve noticed some common traits among the clients who have made the most positive changes in their lives. They are curious, willing to learn about themselves, and being prepared to put in the work. I can guide you. And I will support you always. But nobody can do it for you.'),\n",

It takes great bravery to open up to anyone about the struggles we’re experiencing, or even just the fact we’re experiencing a struggle at all.
